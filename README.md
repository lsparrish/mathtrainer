Math Trainer
===

This is a collection of tools for training automaticity in math.

I've stuck to browser side HTML/JS/CSS for accessibility reasons. These tools are meant to be useful from a phone, laptop, etc. Mobile with touchscreen has buttons on screen.

Currently there are two modulus 5 training games that let you turn off zero answers for a total of 4 answers. This is meant to reduce "trivial complexity" such as trying to pick one of 10 keys on a keyboard or touchscreen. Getting it down to 4 keys makes it more like a video game.

[Mod 5 Drill](https://raw.githack.com/lsparrish/mathtrainer/refs/heads/master/mod5drill.html): I focused on making modulus 5 multiplication approachable for a 4 year old. So there are hint tables for the answers, and sounds. All of which can be turned off.

[Calibrio](https://raw.githack.com/lsparrish/mathtrainer/refs/heads/master/calibrio.html): This is also a mod 5 trainer, but with emphasis on slowing down if you aren't sure, while speeding up based on past progress. The skill you are trying to develop with this is self-calibration to the correct (for you, at the time) level of "desireable difficulty".

TODOs
---
- make it work well for toddlers on phone or laptop with html5 container or something
- better fraction training
- more branches of math in general
- make UI more similar between mod5drill and calibrio
